# Error-Runs-Group

## Description
This repository is part 2 of my Error Project. Figures out where in the game the most errors and runs occur.

## Part 1
Gather Information on what inning group the most errors and runs occur.
The inning groups consist of:
  - 1-3 innings
  - 4-6 innings
  - 7+ innings

## Part 2 
Explain the total errors gap.
While gathering information for the inning groups, errors that occured more than once in one inning got counted as an individual error instead of multiple.
